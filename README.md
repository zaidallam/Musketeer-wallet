## About The Project

This is a concept multi-signature wallet that allows users to create multisignature wallets, deposit ETH, initiate transactions, and delete/approve pending transactions. All transactions from the wallet require approval from at least 2 of the other 3 participating members. The project features a basic front end to interact with the wallet. 
This is a two-page concept project that was built using several fameworks and libraries, including but not limited to the Truffle Suite, Ethers, Next, and Tailwind.
Although the UI for this project allows full use of all features of the wallet, it is simple and unopinionated.
This project and its code were engineered solely by Zaid Allam.
